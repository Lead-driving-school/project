        <h2 class="subtitle">MISSION STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>Learning how to drive and getting your driver's license is a major milestone in every teenager's life. We at Michigan Driving School take great pride in providing the right foundation of classroom comprehension and hands on skills to help our students become safe and confident behind the wheel. Every teenager has the ability to become a responsible driver. Michigan Driving School's mission is to provide each student with the knowledge and foresight to become a safe driver.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">NOT ALL DRIVING SCHOOLS ARE THE SAME</h2>
        <p>As a future driver or parent of a future driver, you understand just how important it is to find a driving school that is safe, uses MVA-certified instructors, and offers relevant classes. While there are a lot of different driving schools out there, none are as equipped to educate and protect you as Elite Driving School is. Elite Driving School has been operating for the past 23 years with the same mission: to provide our students with the best possible chance for staying safe on the roads.

            <br>Elite Driving School was founded in 1991 by Ron Biederman, with the goal of establishing a higher level for driver education in the Owings Mills area. With dedication and compassion, Elite Driving School set a new standard for other schools in the area. Although Mr. Biederman is no longer with us, his desire to make our new drivers safer lives on.

            <br>In 1996 Elite Driving School was purchased by David Resnick. His renewed vigor and enthusiasm helped Elite to continue its educational excellence. Elite is an active member of the community, supporting our students as well as other local businesses in the Owings Mills area. Our continued support of high school newspapers, sports teams, yearbooks and project safe post-prom parties has helped our youth stay competitive and safe.</p>
